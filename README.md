# SIPRAD-demo
Demonstration of single image phase reconstruction via automatic differentiation (SIPRAD) as was published in [AI-enabled Lorentz microscopy for quantitative imaging of nanoscale magnetic spin textures](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-024-01285-8).

For a more up-to-date demonstration of SIPRAD that can be implemented in your own work, please refer to the [PyLorentz](https://github.com/PyLorentz/PyLorentz/) project which is an actively maintained codebase for Lorentz TEM analysis. There you can find full example notebooks of how to use SIPRAD.
